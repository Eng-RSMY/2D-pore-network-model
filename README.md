# 2D pore-network model
A pore-network model is a geometrical approximnation of complex porous media where large pores are defined as pore-bodies to store fluids and narrow channels between them are defined as pore-throats. 
A two-dimensional pore-network model generator with arbitrary pore-body and pore-throat size distribution is written in MATLAB. The code calculates single-phase flow through pore-throats and solves for pressure in pore-bodies. The ouput is a representation of the generated pore-network with predicted pressure field and its average distribution.
